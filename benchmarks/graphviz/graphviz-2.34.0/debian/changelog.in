graphviz (2.18-1ubuntu3) intrepid; urgency=low

  * Adapted for upstream nightly builds by applying graphviz_2.18-1ubuntu2.diff.gz
    to CVS sources and adding the debian/ subtree to CVS.

  * Removed all debian/patches/[0123]* and emptied debian/patches/series
    since upstream should never need patches.
    - Drop 0_tcl_manpages_section - applied upstream
    - Drop 0_autoreconf_run - not needed
    - Drop 1_disable_lumping_all_include_directories - applied upstream
    - Drop 0_libtool_linking_reorder_workaround - not needed - previously disabled
    - Drop 0_bindings_documentation - applied upstream
    - Drop 0_versioned_plugin_config_file - applied upstream
   
  * Enabled "--with-rsvg" to provide support for node images in svg format.
  * Enabled "--with-devil" to provide support for additional output formats.
  * Enabled "--with-gdk-pixbuf" to provide support for additional output formats.
  * Enabled "--with-ipsepcola" (was only disabled because of concern about C++ portability)

graphviz (2.18-1ubuntu1) intrepid; urgency=low

  * Merge from debian unstable, remaining changes:
    - Build depend on liblualib50-dev instead of liblua5.1-0-dev.
    - Drop libttf-dev (libttf-dev is in universe) (LP: #174749).
    - Replace gs-common with ghostscript.
    - Build-depend on python-dev instead of python2.4-dev or python2.5-dev.
    - Mention the correct python version for the python bindings in the
      package description.

graphviz (2.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
     - Move from Tcl/Tk 8.4 to 8.5.
     - Now build python2.4 and python2.5 modules.
  * debian/control:
     - Replace tcl8.4-dev and tk8.4-dev with tcl8.5-dev and tk8.5-dev in
       Build-Depends accordingly.
     - Update the version in the long description of libgv-tcl.
     - Add python2.5-dev to Build-Depends.
     - Mention both versions in the long description of libgv-python.
     - Drop libttf-dev from Build-Depends since that's a deprecated
       package, replaced by libfreetype6-dev (which is already there),
       thanks to Moritz Muehlenhoff for the notice (Closes: #473487).
  * debian/libgv-tcl.install:
     - Delete the entry about pkgIndex.tcl since it's now shipped under
       the tcl directory.
  * debian/libgv-python/install:
     - Add “usr/lib/graphviz/python{24,25}”, later rearranged through
       debian/rules.
  * debian/pyversions:
     - Add it, containing “2.4,2.5”.
  * debian/rules:
     - Pass an extra flag to configure: “--without-rsvg” to avoid an extra
       plugin to be built, which would pull many other dependencies. A new
       binary package might be introduced later, with both gtk and rsvg
       plugins.
     - Bump shlibs, new symbols.
     - Use “pyversions -s” rather than “pyversions -d”.
     - Use “--enable-python{24,25}” instead of just “--enable-python”.
     - Install both python modules under appropriate site-packages
       directories.
     - Duplicate gv.py in both directories, then taken care of by
       python-support.
     - Get rid of tclpkg/gv/gv.R and tclpkg/gv/php_gv.h through dh_clean
       to keep the diff clean.
  * Drop workaround for FTBFS with gcc-4.3, fixed upstream:
     - 2_workaround_ftbfs_with_gcc-4.3.
  * Backport fix from CVS, preventing all include directories from being
    lumped together, does causing python2.5 to be misbuilt (using
    python2.4 includes).
     - Add 1_disable_lumping_all_include_directories: Actual fix.
     - Add 0_autoreconf_run: Needed since a Makefile.am is touched.
     - Disable 0_libtool_linking_reorder_workaround: no longer applies
       because of the autoreconf run.

graphviz (2.16.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add workaround for FTBFS with gcc-4.3 (Closes: #466810):

graphviz (2.16.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
     - Fixes regressions in dotty (Closes: #461530).
  * Replaced “-V” with “-V 'libgraphviz4 (>= 2.16)'” in the dh_makeshlibs
    call since no shlibs bump is required for this new upstream release.
  * Dropped patch (merged upstream):
     - 2_ocaml_tweak.
     - 0_autoreconf_run (it was only needed because of 2_ocaml_tweak).
  * Refreshed patches:
     - 0_versioned_plugin_config_file.
     - 0_bindings_documentation.
  * Moved sections, resolving override disparities:
     - libgv-python: from interpreters to python.
     - graphviz-dev: from graphics to devel.
  * Now ship diffimg since it actually looks useful to at least someone,
    thanks to David Liontooth for having requested it (Closes: #460595).
    Done by reverting the diffimg deletion in “install” target.
  * Adapted Tcl bindings: moved to a subdirectory of /usr/lib/tcltk to
    comply with the Tcl/Tk policy.
  * Adapted the manpage accordingly: in the “load” call, adjusted the
    path to the shared object.
  * Dropped NEWS.Debian since its content wasn't really what one would
    expect when stumbling upon it, thanks to Steve Langasek for the
    original comment.
  * Refreshed README.Debian:
     - Dropped the note about gpr->gvpr and colorize->gvcolor renames.
       That was done long ago (graphviz 1.10).
     - Dropped notices about: bindings, -dev, and -doc packages.
     - Updated pointers to examples and contrib files (Closes: #459955).
     - Added a note about diffimg now being shipped (see above).
     - Kept notes about the suggested packages mostly as-is, they need an
       update.
     - Refreshed entry about graphviz.7 (included upstream).
     - Included former NEWS.Debian's item about C# and Java bindings.
  * Improved handling of libgraphvizN-config-update:
     - Build it from perlpod: debian/libgraphviz-config-update.pod.in
       (and delete generated files in the “clean” target).
     - Use a placeholder to refresh the SONAME automatically.
     - Dropped debian/libgraphviz4-config-update.1 accordingly.
  * No longer ship any .la file. Remaining ones were shipped through
    libgraphviz-dev and libgv-tcl. Reverse dependencies can still be built
    from sources without any troubles, so this deletion sounds safe.

graphviz (2.16-3ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  * Merge with Debian; remaining changes:
    - Drop libttf-dev (libttf-dev is in universe) (LP: #174749).
    - Replace gs-common with ghostscript.
    - Build-depend on python-dev instead of python2.4-dev.
    - Build-depend on liblua50-dev instead of liblua5.1-0-dev.
    - Mention the correct python version for the python bindings in the
      package description.

graphviz (2.16-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Renamed libgraphviz4-dev to libgraphviz-dev since a single version is
    supported at once:
     - debian/control:
        - Replaced libgraphviz4-dev with libgraphviz-dev.
        - Added “Conflicts/Replaces: libgraphviz4-dev (<< 2.16-3)” to the
          libgraphviz-dev package so that upgrades are possible for people
          having installed the libgraphviz4-dev package from experimental.
        - Added “Replaces: libgraphviz3-dev” at the same time.
     - debian/rules: Removed $(SONAME) from libgraphviz$(SONAME)-dev.
     - debian/libgraphviz4-dev.install -> debian/ libgraphviz-dev.install.
  * Added “LDFLAGS="-Wl,--as-needed"” to the ./configure call so as to
    avoid extra linking. It works for all binaries (/usr/bin/*) at least.
  * Since the above isn't sufficient to get rid of extra linking in
    libraries (because of libtool's bug #347650), the following patch
    against config/ltmain.sh and libltdl/ltmain.sh has been added:
     - 0_libtool_linking_reorder_workaround.
  * Added “--without-ipsepcola” to ./configure to avoid FTBFS on arm. The
    problem is due to a wrong linking of C++ code (since g++ isn't used
    at the moment). Not that easy to fix (but being worked on), disabling
    this feature for now.
  * Nuke trailing whitespaces in various debian/* files.
  * Order ./configure arguments, grouping them by category (build options,
    general options, features, bindings).
  * Switch to a build-time update of config.{guess,sub} scripts:
     - Listed in $(CONFIG_SCRIPTS), to be updated on each new upstream
       release (added to debian/README.Debian-packaging).
     - Updated during the “configure” target, dh_clean'd during the
       “clean” one.
     - The Build-Depends on autotools-dev was there already.
  * Deleted patch (no longer needed, see above):
     - 0_autotools_config_files.
  * Don't ship empty directories, by deleting /usr/lib/graphviz for php
    and python bindings, rather than /usr/lib/graphviz/$LANGUAGE.
  * Fixed ruby bindings, now that a policy draft exists:
     - Ship the ruby module where it belongs (Closes: #454622).
     - Updated patch (the RUBYLIB trick is no longer needed):
        - 0_bindings_documentation.
     - Added an explicit dependency on ruby1.8.
  * Moved the build dependency from libgd2-xpm-dev to libgd2-noxpm-dev,
    since this latter is sufficient, and since appropriate dependencies
    are computed (libgd2-xpm | libgd2-noxpm). This allows for more
    flexibility from a user point of view (Closes: #459537). Many thanks
    to Ben Finney for the notice. The only change regarding the supported
    features is that “xbm” is no longer supported in “loadimage”
    according to the output of “dot -v”.
  * Removed unneeded “Conflicts: graphviz (<< 2.12)” from libgv-ruby,
    which got here when copying the libgv-tcl stanza.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.7.3 (no change needed).
  * Added a copyright statement about the Debian packaging.

graphviz (2.16-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added patches:
     - 2_ocaml_tweaks:
        - Make the generation of native objects conditional since ocamlopt
          isn't available on every arch. Upstream didn't include the
          conditional statements when merging the submitted patch. This patch
          adds an AM_CHECK_PROG on ocamlopt and conditionally adds the native
          objects to OCAML_data when needed (Closes: Bug#451763).
        - Also delete duplicates in the OCAML_data, while adding the missing
          gv.cmo file.
     - 0_autoreconf_run: Needed again since configure.ac and a Makefile.am are
       touched. Only keep in there the changes to aclocal.m4, configure, and
       all Makefile.in's.
  * Dropped OCaml-related files (merged upstream) and adapted related
    instructions in debian/rules:
     - debian/ocaml/Makefile.ocaml
     - debian/ocaml/META.gv

 -- Cyril Brulebois <cyril.brulebois@enst-bretagne.fr>  Mon, 19 Nov 2007 02:47:51 +0100

graphviz (2.16-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #438420).
  * Fixed regression in this new upstream release:
     - Corrupted output creation for certain inputs (Closes: #432890).
  * Fixed bug:
     - Invalid EPS code creation (Closes: #397060). It was probably a bug in
       2.8, thus might be fixed in 2.12 already. This version closes it for
       sure at least. Further explanations from upstream are available on the
       bugreport.
  * Refreshed patches:
     - 0_autotools_config_files: Updated to autotools-dev/20070725.1. Added a
       TODO item about moving this patch to a build-time update.
     - 0_versioned_plugin_config_file: Drop the first hunk, which modified
       cmd/dot/Makefile.am to not run “dot -c”. Upstream now has a better
       way to detect the installation for packaging purposes (using DESTDIR).
     - 0_bindings_documentation: Updated lua manpage from lua5.0 old style to
       lua5.1, thanks to Enrico Tassi (Closes: #448365).
  * Dropped patches:
     - 3_manpages_fix: Merged upstream.
     - 3_manpages_hyphen_fix: Merged upstream.
     - 1_diffimg_Makefile.am_fix: Merged upstream.
     - 1_lefty_fix: Merged upstream.
     - 3_gnomeui_configure.ac_fix: Merged upstream.
     - 3_ruby-bindings_configure.ac_fix: Merged upstream.
     - 3_php5-bindings_configure.ac_fix: Merged upstream.
     - 3_bindings_Makefile.am_fix: Merged upstream.
     - 3_lua-bindings_configure.ac_fix: Merged upstream.
     - 0_autoreconf_run: No longer needed, given the dropped patches.
  * Added patch:
     - 0_tcl_manpages_section: Upstream ships tcl-related manpages in “mann”
       instead of “man3” and wants to keep it that way. This patch modifies
       the headers so that they contain “3” instead of “n”.
  * debian/rules:
     - Use a SONAME variable to ease SONAME transitions.
     - Remove the extra “rm” calls now that upstream's “make distclean” is
       sufficient.
     - Modify the manpage handling since upstream now installs *.n manpages
       under usr/share/man/mann. Also adapted some *.install files to install
       some additional manpages.
     - Drop the parameter of the “-V” option in the “dh_makeshlibs” call,
       since a dependency based on the upstream version number is sufficient
       by now.
     - Do not install the “diffimg” binary, see NEWS.Debian.
  * debian/NEWS:
     - Add a note about “diffimg”.
     - Add a status update about the bindings, especially about the python
       one.
  * debian/libgraphvizN.install:
     - Made SONAME-independant: only specifies the overrides directory, no
       longer the filename.
  * debian/README.Debian-packaging:
     - Updated to match the autoreconf patch dropping, and document the needed
       automake version in case this patch has to be added again.
  * debian/graphviz.7:
     - Dropped, merged upstream.
  * SONAME 3 -> 4 transition (all files are in debian/):
     - rules:
        - Adjusted SONAME variable.
        - Adjusted versioned dependency for the shlibs.
     - libgraphviz3-config-update.1:
     - libgraphviz3.install:
     - libgraphviz3.lintian-overrides:
     - libgraphviz3.postinst:
     - libgraphviz3.postrm:
        - Renamed with s/3/4/.
     - libgraphviz4.lintian-overrides:
        - Updated SONAME in each override.
     - libgraphviz4.post{inst,rm}:
        - Updated with s/3/4/.
     - patches/0_versioned_plugin_config_file:
        - Updated with s/config3/config4/.
     - control:
        - Adjusted libgv-ocaml long description, which mentions the
          libgraphvizN-dev package.
  * debian/libgraphviz4.lintian-overrides:
     - In addition to the SONAME bump, deletion of “libexpr” since it is now
       used a convenience library, and addition of “libcgraph”.
  * debian/watch:
     - Upstream now uses x.y.z and not only x.y, updated regex to catch
       [0-9.]+\.tar\.gz (the development snapshots are in another directory).
  * debian/control:
     - Version the B-D on libgd2-xpm-dev (>= 2.0.35) to ensure the internal
       code copy isn't used.
  * NOT added support for the gdk-pixbuf renderer:
     - It supports .bmp .ico .jpg .png .tif.
     - debian/control would need an additional B-D on libgtk2.0-dev.
     - debian/rules would need an additional “--with-gdk-pixbuf”.
     - But that pulls gtk, which is far too much for what graphviz has to do.
     - Therefore, added a “--without-gdk-pixbuf” to ensure it isn't built,
       even if gdk-pixbuf development files are available.

graphviz (2.12-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified bindings handling:
     - tclpkg/gv/Makefile.am is now patched to set “-module -avoid-version” in
       LDFLAGS. There are dynamically loadable modules rather than shared
       libraries.
     - Added patch for this:
        - 3_bindings_module_avoid-version_options.
     - Refreshed patch so as to refresh the appropriate Makefile.in (with only
       an automake run):
        - 0_autoreconf_run.
     - There's still Tcl parts that are versioned.
  * Fixed libgv-guile description, thanks to Kanru Chen (Closes: #439385).
  * Fixed libgv-lua (Closes: #439525):
     - After a discussion with Enrico Tassi, it has been decided to only build
       against lua5.1, and not against both lua5.0 and lua5.1 as planned at
       the beginning. Description updated to mention lua5.1 explicitely.
     - debian/libgv-lua.install: Only mention the .so now (the .la's are
       probably unneeded for bindings, they'll probably be amm dropped once
       the tcl case has been sorted out).
     - debian/rules: Some additional work is done to make it loadable
       directly, and to document the used liblua version.
        - Rename libgv_lua.so into liblua$(LUA_VERSION)-libgv.so.
        - Add a symlink from /usr/lib/lua5.1/gv.so to the .so in /usr/lib.
     - It looks like it is now usable directly with a single “require "gv"”.
     - The documentation has still to be updated, though.
  * Fixed libgv-ocaml:
     - Rebuild against ocaml 3.10 (Closes: #441494).
     - debian/control: Added a Suggests: on ocaml-base-nox to the -dev package
       since it is needed for the OCaml development files, but not a stronger
       relation since one will usually want to use the C headers.
     - debian/control: Also added a Suggests: on ocaml-findlib to the -dev
       package since it is suggested to use findlib to use the package (and
       per pkg-ocaml-maint policy).
     - debian/control: Modified long descriptions to detail the decision about
       the OCaml binary packages.
     - debian/rules: Moved the library to the stublibs directory of the
       current ocaml version. Moved the devel files to the -dev package.
       Drop the .la file and the now-empty /usr/lib/graphviz/ocaml directory.
     - debian/ocaml/Makefile.ocaml: Add some instructions to build the missing
       library files so that it is possible to actually load the gv library in
       the interpreter. This file is copied into the source tree after the
       usual build, and then use to build them. Its “clean” target is called
       from debian/rules, and it gets removed before the usual “clean”.
     - debian/ocaml/META.gv: Add META file used to handle OCaml dependencies.
  * Improved libgv-python (Closes: #440829):
     - debian/control: Added python-support to Build-Depends, python:Depends
       to libgv-python's Depends.
     - debian/rules: Added a call to dh_pysupport. Move to a site-packages
       directory depending on the current default python version.
     - Dropped the use of “-lpython”:
        - Added patch: 3_python-bindings_configure.ac_fix.
        - Refreshed patch: 0_autoreconf_run.
     - Dropped .la file.
     - Other points of the bugreports are already mentioned above.
  * Other bindings (libgv-guile, libgv-perl, libgv-ruby):
     - Dropped .la by specifying only the .so in their respective .install
       file, instead of “*”.
  * Adapted documentation:
     - Lua: updated instructions (package.loadlib, new path).
     - Python: one can now “import gv” directly.
     - Refreshed patch: 0_bindings_documentation.
  * debian/control: (thanks to dpkg 1.14.7)
     - Rename XS-Vcs-* to Vcs-*.
     - Move the Homepage from the description to the new header.

graphviz (2.12-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added bindings:
     - guile      (Closes: #360969);
     - lua        (Closes: #360971);
     - ocaml      (Closes: #360975);
     - php5       (Closes: #360973);
     - python     (Closes: #360974);
     - ruby       (Closes: #360978).
  * Added Build-Depends accordingly:
     - guile-1.6-dev;
     - liblua5.1-0-dev;
     - ocaml-nox;
     - php5-dev, php5-cli;
     - python2.4-dev, python-minimal;
     - ruby1.8-dev, ruby.
  * Some patches are needed to enable some bindings:
     - added 3_bindings_Makefile.am_fix, since some variables were missing;
     - added 3_ruby-bindings_configure.ac_fix to force ``-lruby1.8'' instead
       of ``-lruby'', which isn't working;
     - added 3_lua-bindings_configure.ac_fix to detect lua correctly.
     - added 3_php5-bindings_configure.ac_fix to fix include paths (basically,
       it does s/php/php5/g on this line). Maybe php5-cli might be unneeded,
       if the detection of the php binary is turned off (it looks like
       unneeded).
  * Added a variable (control, rules) for ocaml, so that the Depends: is set
    on the correct ocaml-base-nox-${F:OCamlABI} package.
  * Binding manpages are shipped as gv_*.3, after some modifications to the
    upstream templates, stored in the 0_bindings_documentation patch.
  * Enabled diffimg:
     - modified 0_disable_diffimg to only modify contrib/Makefile.am, since
       now an autoconf/automake round is needed, due to the modifications to
       configure.ac et al. This way it can be pop'd.
     - renamed into 1_diffimg_Makefile.am_fix, since diffimg is now built,
       thanks to a slight modification to the Makefile.am: there was an
       erroneous condition on WITH_LIBGD, instead of WITH_MYLIBGD (this is
       fixed in CVS).
  * Added README.Debian-packaging to document some packaging howtos (at the
    moment, what should be done to get the last patch: autoreconf run).
  * Refreshed 0_autotools_config_files to patch config.{guess,sub} in the
    following directories, with files from autotools-dev_20070306.1:
     - config
     - lib/gd/config
     - libltdl
  * Added 1_lefty_fix, which is a backport of a regression (2.8 -> 2.12) fix
    for lefty, thanks to Sune Vuorela for reporting, and to Emden R. Gansner
    for the patch.
  * Adjusted clean target in debian/rules to clean appropriately.
  * Added the -V 'libgraphviz3 (>= 2.12-3)' parameter to the dh_makeshlibs
    call so that the appropriate library version is depended on, avoiding the
    hardcoded values in the control file, and the duplicates in the Depends:
    fields after substitution. Now ${shlibs:Depends} is used instead, almost
    everywhere. libgraphviz3-dev still has hardcoded dependencies, see
    TODO.Debian. Also turned ``-a'' into ``-plibgraphviz3'' since it is the
    only package needing an shlibs file and ldconfig calls in post{inst,rm}
    scripts.
  * Added installation of /usr/bin/dot under /usr/sbin in the libgraphviz3
    package, so that it can be called when needed, during libgraphviz3 or
    libgraphviz3-*-plugin installation or removal. Added a call to ``mv'' in
    debian/rules to rename it to libgraphviz3-config-update since dh_install
    doesn't allow renaming.
  * Changed 0_test_fix into 0_versioned_plugin_config_file:
     - Former patch needed so that no ``dot -c'' is run at build time.
     - Adjusted configuration file accordingly, by patching
       lib/gvc/gvconfig.c, using "config3" instead of "config".
  * Added ``--list-missing'' option to dh_install, so that files not installed
    are spotted easily.
  * Maintainer scripts, plugin configuration file:
     - Dropped debian/postinst and debian/postrm, the configuration
       (``dot -c'') of the plugins is now handled as documented in
       through libgraphviz3(|*-plugin).{postinst,postrm}, as documented in
       README.Debian-packaging.
     - Added a check and a removal-when-needed for the ancient "config" file.
     - Added a manpage accordingly.
  * Fixed some hyphens in Debian-specific manpages.
  * Fixed broken links in index.html by not compressing PDF files (``-X.pdf''
    added to the ``dh_compress -i'' call), since they are in a separate
    package, there's not much space loss, and it makes users' life easier
    (Closes: #378522).
  * Adapted lintian overrides since the output changed (SONAMES are now
    sorted, see #428681, fixed in lintian 1.23.32).
  * Fixed pango plugin misconfiguration, due to some autotools blackmagic. Now
    that ./configure and the like are regenerated, everything seems to be
    fine (Closes: #424883, #422859). Please also note that the upstream
    graphviz-cairo package is now superseded by the graphviz package.
  * Added missing -dev packages to the Depends: of the libgraphviz3-dev
    package, in particular libexpat1-dev (libfreetype6-dev seems to be no
    longer needed), using d-devlibdeps from the d-shlibs package. Build
    dependency added accordingly (Closes: #404384).
  * Set the Maintainer field to myself.
  * Do not ignore ``make distclean'' errors.
  * Added XS-Vcs-Git and XS-Vcs-Browser fields in debian/control.
  * Moved ``Apps/Graphics'' to ``Applications/Graphics'' for the menu
    transition.

graphviz (2.12-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Re-enable lefty, which was a leftover during the 2.8 -> 2.12 upgrade:
     - turned back configure's --without-x to --with-x;
     - adjusted graphviz.install to install *.lefty under
       /usr/share/graphviz/lefty
    (Closes: #423541).

 -- Cyril Brulebois <cyril.brulebois@enst-bretagne.fr>  Sun, 13 May 2007 21:20:24 +0200

graphviz (2.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed gnomeui + pango/cairo pulling: (Closes: #422862, #422873)
     - added 3_gnomeui_configure_fix patch: adds support in configure.ac
       for --with(out)-gnomeui, so that it can be used to disable the link
       against gnomeui libraries even if they are found;
     - added configure_autoconf_rerun: contains the modifications to configure
       after autoconf has been rerun;
     - added --without-gnomeui and --without-pangocairo in debian/rules
       accordingly;
     - added --without-gtk as well, and turned --with-x into --without-x
       since the associated shared objects weren't built anyway.
  * The associated features might be added in separate package(s) later.

 -- Cyril Brulebois <cyril.brulebois@enst-bretagne.fr>  Tue, 08 May 2007 17:16:29 +0200

graphviz (2.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    Hopefully it addresses the longstanding rpath issue, since all public
    libraries now belongs to /usr/lib (Closes: #312532, #343476, #360968).
    The problem of language bindings will be addressed in further uploads.
  * Maintainer upload.
     - Added myself in the Uploaders field.
  * ACK previous NMUs: many thanks for having taken care of graphviz when
    needed.
     - Margarita Manterola <marga@debian.org> (no NMU diff in the BTS);
     - Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org> (Closes: #375024, #389396);
     - and my own NMUs (Closes: #399212, #400161).

  [debian/patches]
  * Disabled no longer needed backported patches:
     - 10000_lua_python_bindings;
     - 10918_nop_fix.
  * Disabled the build of the contrib `diffimg' tool since it looks like
    there's a missing .la file:
     - 0_disable_diffimg.
  * Added a patch to handle minus vs hyphen signs in the manpages: 
     - 3_manpages_hyphen_fix. 

  [debian/control]
  * Made the package binNMU safe by switching from `${Source-Version}' to
    `{binary:Version}'.
  * Resplitted packaging into graphviz, libgraphvizN, libgraphvizN-dev,
    graphviz-doc, where N matches the SONAME, currently 3.
  * Additional packages also count the following bindings: libgv-perl and
    libgv-tcl, which were included in the monolithic graphviz package before.
    The transition should be quite smooth this way. The bindings package will
    be named libgv-* so as to avoid name clashing with e.g. libgraphviz-perl,
    which is a pure perl package. It also reflects the name of the bindings
    (shared objects). The dependencies have still to be polished, that is
    listed in TODO(.Debian).
     - Perl's "gv"  has been moved under /usr/lib/perl5, according to the
       Debian Perl Policy, and this module is loadable without the additional
       `use lib' line, which can be kept though because:
         1) it is harmless;
         2) it should ensure compatibility with default upstream installation
            paths.
     - Tcl files are kept under /usr/lib/graphviz/tcl, as in the previous
       packages. When loading it through the "load" instruction specified in
       the manpage, everything's alright. But if it is loaded using the
       following, an error is displayed, although apparently harmless:
         % package require Tcldot
         Error: invalid api in config: libgvplugin_usershape_gd.so.2 usershape
         2.12
       It can happen when an older graphviz package hasn't been purged, so
       that an older config file is still present under /usr/lib/graphviz.
  * Not added a conflict between libgraphviz3 and former versions of graphviz,
    since there is no file overlapping, with both SONAME bump and package
    resplit (in particular thanks to the binding packages).
  * Added a conflict between new graphviz-doc and older graphviz, since
    documentation and examples are now in graphviz-doc.
  * Added a transitional graphviz-dev package to ensure a smooth upgrade from
    graphviz-dev to libgraphviz3-dev.
  * Adjusted all the descriptions, and the sections the packages belong to.

  [debian/rules]
  * Revamped the install target of the debian Makefile to use dh_install and
    *.install files instead of dh_movefiles and *.{dirs,files}. These
    *.install files have been adjusted to be as clean as possible. Some files
    (documentation, examples) present in the previous packages might now be
    missing, but it is already known, see the updated TODO(.Debian) file.
  * Turned the dh_shlibdeps call into a normal call w/o rpath since upstream
    now ships under /usr/lib and no longer under /usr/lib/graphviz.
  * Deleted the `-n' option of `dh_makeshlibs' so that the needed `ldconfig'
    calls are added in the maintainer scripts.
  * Added an override for libgraphviz3 since we are aware of the multiple
    share objects, and since lintian signals that all have `3' as SONAME,
    which is considered an error...
  * Renamed menu to graphviz.menu to ensure it gets installed properly.
  * Changed the ``make install'' to using ``DESTDIR='' instead of ``prefix='',
    thanks to Alexander Sack.
  * Added dh_perl calls, to be able to use ${perl:Depends} in the control
    file, even though no dependency is added for now.

graphviz (2.8-2.6) unstable; urgency=low

graphviz (2.8-2.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Switched to the quilt system to keep the patches readable and handy. As a
    convention, the following prefixes are used:
     0 - Debian-specific fix
     1 - Backported fix (followed by a 4-digit upstream bug number)
     2 - Submitted fix (followed by a 4-digit upstream bug number)
     3 - Not-yet submitted fix
    Patches already present:
     - 0_autotools_config_files:
         Adds config.{guess,sub} from /usr/share/misc (from the autotools-dev
         package). debian/rules adjusted accordingly so that it doesn't
         refresh them. The autotools-dev B-D could probably be dropped.
     - 0_test_fix:
         Fixes an error during the build due to the fact that the installation
         is not done directly into the system but on a subdirectory.
     - 10000_lua_python_bindings:
         Backport from upstream modification into configure.ac, patch
         generated after having run `autoconf'.
     - 10918_nop_fix:
         Backport introduced in 2.8-2.4.
     - 3_manpages_fix:
         See the next two items.
  * Added a patch to fix some warnings in the manpages (Closes: #381063).
  * Added a graphviz.7 manpage and a reference to it in README.Debian.
    Thanks to Joachim Berdal Haga <jbh@lupus.ig3.net> for the documentation
    effort this manpage is based on (Closes: #389105).
  * Updated debian/rules to use dh_installman to handle manpages.
  * Modified debian/graphviz.dirs so that the build is less vulnerable to
    behaviour modifications of core utils (Closes: #376049).
    Thanks to Florent Bayle <florent@sarcelle.net> for the patch.
  * Updated URL in debian/control (Closes: #377691).
  * Improved descriptions in debian/control.
  * Removed the erroneous trailing backslash in debian/graphviz-doc.doc-base.
  * Bumped Standards-Version from 3.6.2 to 3.7.2 (no change needed).
  * Bumped debhelper compatibility from 4 to 5 (no change needed).

graphviz (2.8-2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Fixed totally broken `nop' utility by applying a patch backported from the
    2.9 version, fixing the linking against a wrong library. Since the current
    packaging doesn't provide any means of keeping patches separate, the files
    cmd/tools/Makefile.{am,in} are patched directly, using the patch submitted
    in the BTS (closes: #359870).

graphviz (2.8-2.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * When moving the demo tree into /usr/share/doc/graphviz/examples, don't
    try to move demo/pathplan_data/* after demo/*, since the latter includes
    the former anyhow; fixes FTBFS. (Closes: #373254)
