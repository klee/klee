</TABLE>
As the figures suggest, the shapes <TT>rect</TT> and <TT>rectangle</TT> are synonyms for <TT>box</TT>, and <TT>none</TT> is a synonym for <TT>plaintext</TT>.
Also, unlike the rest, we have shown these last two 
without <TT>style=filled</TT>
to indicate the normal use. If fill were turned on, the label text would
appear in a filled rectangle.
<P>
The geometries of polygon-based shapes are also affected
by the node attributes 
<A HREF=attrs.html#d:regular><TT>regular</TT></A>, 
<A HREF=attrs.html#d:peripheries><TT>peripheries</TT></A> and
<A HREF=attrs.html#d:orientation><TT>orientation</TT></A>.
If <TT>shape="polygon"</TT>, the attributes
<A HREF=attrs.html#d:sides><TT>sides</TT></A>, 
<A HREF=attrs.html#d:skew><TT>skew</TT></A> and
<A HREF=attrs.html#d:distortion><TT>distortion</TT></A> are also used.
If unset, they default to 4, 0.0 and 0.0, respectively.
The point shape is special in that it is
only affected by the <A HREF=attrs.html#d:peripheries><TT>peripheries</TT></A>, 
<A HREF=attrs.html#d:width><TT>width</TT></A> and
<A HREF=attrs.html#d:height><TT>height</TT></A> attributes.

<H2><A NAME=record>Record-based Nodes</A></H2>
These are specified by shape values of "record" and "Mrecord".
The structure of a record-based node is determined by 
its <A HREF=attrs.html#d:label><TT>label</TT></A>,
which has the following schema:
  <TABLE>
  <TR><TD ALIGN=right><I>rlabel</I><TD>=<TD><I>field</I> ( '|' <I>field</I> )*</TR>
  <TR><TD ALIGN=right>where <I>field</I><TD>=<TD>fieldId</I> or '{' <I>rlabel</I> '}'</TR>
  <TR><TD ALIGN=right>and <I>fieldId</I><TD>=<TD> [ '<' <I>string</I> '>'] [ <I>string</I> ]</TR>
  </TABLE>
Braces, vertical bars and angle brackets must be escaped with
a backslash character if you wish them to appear as a literal character.
Spaces are interpreted as separators between tokens,
so they must be escaped if you want spaces in the text.
<P>
The first string in <I>fieldId</I> assigns a portname to the field and can 
be combined with the node name to indicate where to attach an edge
to the node. (See <A HREF=attrs.html#k:portPos>portPos</A>.)
The second string is used as the text for the field; it supports the usual
<A HREF=attrs.html#k:escString>escape sequences</A> &#92;n, &#92;l and &#92;r.
<P>
Visually, a record is a box, with fields represented by alternating
rows of horizontal or vertical subboxes. The Mrecord shape is identical
to a record shape, except that the outermost box has rounded corners.
Flipping between horizontal and vertical layouts is done by nesting
fields in braces "{...}". The top-level orientation in a record is
horizontal. Thus, a record with label "A | B | C | D" will have 4 fields 
oriented left to right, while "{A | B | C | D}" will have them 
from top to bottom and "A | { B | C } | D" will have "B" over "C", with
"A" to the left and "D" to the right of "B" and "C".
<P> 
The initial orientation of a record node depends on the
<A HREF="attrs.html#d:rankdir">rankdir</A> attribute. If this attribute
is <TT>TB</TT> (the default) or <TT>TB</TT>, corresponding to vertical
layouts, the top-level fields in a record are displayed horizontally.
If, however, this attribute is <TT>LR</TT> or <TT>RL</TT>, 
corresponding to horizontal layouts, the top-level fields are 
displayed vertically.
<P>
As an example of a record node, the dot input
<XMP>
digraph structs {
    node [shape=record];
    struct1 [label="<f0> left|<f1> mid&#92; dle|<f2> right"];
    struct2 [label="<f0> one|<f1> two"];
    struct3 [label="hello&#92;nworld |{ b |{c|<here> d|e}| f}| g | h"];
    struct1:f1 -> struct2:f0;
    struct1:f2 -> struct3:here;
}
</XMP>

yields the figure<BR>
<IMG SRC=record.gif>
<P>
If we add the line
<XMP>
    rankdir=LR
</XMP>
we get the layout<BR>
<IMG SRC=record2.gif>
<P>
If we change node <TT>struct1</TT> to have shape <TT>Mrecord</TT>,
it then looks like:<BR>
<IMG SRC=mrecord.gif>

<H2><A NAME="d:style">Styles for Nodes</A></H2>
The <A HREF=attrs.html#d:style><TT>style</TT></A>
attribute can be used to modify the appearance of a node.
At present, there are 8 style values recognized:
<TT>filled</TT>, <TT>invisible</TT>, <TT>diagonals</TT>, <TT>rounded</TT>.
<TT>dashed</TT>, <TT>dotted</TT>, <TT>solid</TT> and <TT>bold</TT>.
As usual, the value of the <A HREF=attrs.html#d:style><TT>style</TT></A>
attribute can be a comma-separated list of any of these. If the
style contains conflicts (e.g, <TT>style="dotted, solid"</TT>), the last
attribute wins.
<DL>
<DT><A NAME=d:filled></A><TT>filled</TT>
  <DD>This value indicates that the node's interior should be filled.
The color used is the node's <TT>fillcolor</TT> or, if that's not defined, its
<TT>color</TT>. For unfilled nodes, the interior of the node is transparent to
whatever color is the current graph or cluster background color.
Note that <TT>point</TT> shapes are always filled.
<P>
Thus, the code
<XMP>
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR
  node [shape=box, color=blue]
  node1 [style=filled] 
  node2 [style=filled, fillcolor=red] 
  node0 -> node1 -> node2
}
</XMP>
yields the figure<BR>
<IMG SRC=fill.gif>

<DT><A NAME=d:invisible></A><TT>invisible</TT>
  <DD>Setting this style causes the node not to be displayed at all.
Note that the node is still used in laying out the graph.

<DT><A NAME=d:diagonals></A><TT>diagonals</TT>
  <DD>The diagonals style causes small chords to be drawn near the vertices
of the node's polygon or, in case of circles and ellipses, two chords near
the top and the bottom of the shape. The special node shapes
<A HREF=#d:Msquare><TT>Msquare</TT></A>,
<A HREF=#d:Mcircle><TT>Mcircle</TT></A>, and
<A HREF=#d:Mdiamond><TT>Mdiamond</TT></A>
are simply an ordinary square, circle and
diamond with the diagonals style set.

<DT><A NAME=d:rounded></A><TT>rounded</TT>
  <DD>The rounded style causes the polygonal corners to be smoothed.
Note that this style also applies to record-based nodes. Indeed,
the <TT>Mrecord</TT> shape is simply shorthand for setting this style.
Also, prior to 26 April 2005, the rounded and filled styles were 
mutually exclusive.
<P>
As an example of rounding, dot uses the graph
<XMP>
digraph R {
  rankdir=LR
  node [style=rounded]
  node1 [shape=box]
  node2 [fillcolor=yellow, style="rounded,filled", shape=diamond]
  node3 [shape=record, label="{ a | b | c }"]

  node1 -> node2 -> node3
}
</XMP>
to produce the figure<BR>
<IMG SRC=round.gif>
<DT><A NAME=d:dashed></A><TT>dashed</TT>
  <DD>This style causes the node's border to be drawn as a dashed line.
<DT><A NAME=d:dotted></A><TT>dotted</TT>
  <DD>This style causes the node's border to be drawn as a dotted line.
<DT><A NAME=d:solid></A><TT>solid</TT>
  <DD>This style causes the node's border to be drawn as a solid line,
which is the default.
<DT><A NAME=d:bold></A><TT>bold</TT>
  <DD>This style causes the node's border to be drawn as a bold line.

<P>
Additional styles may be available with a specific code generator.
