.SH DESCRIPTION
.I osage
draws clustered graphs. As input, it takes any graph in the
.I dot
format. It draws the graph recursively. At each level, there will
be a collection of nodes and a collection of cluster subgraphs.
The internals of each cluster subgraph are laid out, then the 
cluster subgraphs and nodes at the current level are positioned
relative to each other, treating each cluster subgraph as a node. 
.P
At each level, the nodes and cluster subgraphs are viewed as rectangles
to be packed together. At present, edges are ignored during packing.
Packing is done using the standard packing functions. In particular,
the graph attributes \fBpack\fP and \fBpackmode\fP control the layout.
Each graph and cluster can specify its own values for these attributes.
Remember also that a cluster inherits its attribute values from
its parent graph.
.P
After all nodes and clusters, edges are routed based on the value of
the \fBsplines\fP attribute.
.SH OUTPUT FORMATS
Osage uses an extensible plugin mechanism for its output renderers,
so to see what output formats your installation of osage supports
you can use ``osage \-Txxx'' (where xxx is an unlikely format)
and check the warning message.
Also, The plugin mechanism supports multiple implementations
of the output formats.
To see what variants are available, use, for example: ``osage \-Tpng:''
and to force a particular variant, use, for example: ``osage \-Tpng:gd''
.P
Traditionally, osage supports the following:
\fB\-Tps\fP (PostScript),
\fB\-Tsvg\fP \fB\-Tsvgz\fP (Structured Vector Graphics),
\fB\-Tfig\fP (XFIG graphics),
\fB\-Tmif\fP (FrameMaker graphics),
\fB\-Thpgl\fP (HP pen plotters), and \fB\-Tpcl\fP (Laserjet printers),
\fB\-Tpng\fP \fB\-Tgif\fP (bitmap graphics),
\fB\-Tdia\fP (GTK+ based diagrams),
\fB\-Timap\fP (imagemap files for httpd servers for each node or edge
that has a non\(hynull "href" attribute.),
\fB\-Tcmapx\fP (client\(hyside imagemap for use in html and xhtml).
Additional less common or more special\(hypurpose output formats
can be found at http://www.graphviz.org/cvs/doc/info/output.html.)
.P
Alternative plugins providing support for a given output format
can be found from the error message resulting from appending a ':' to the format. e.g. \fB-Tpng:\fP
The first plugin listed is always the default.
.SH GRAPH FILE LANGUAGE
Here is a synopsis of the graph file language, normally using the extension \fB.gv\fR, for graphs:
.PP
[\fBstrict\fR] (\fBgraph\fR|\fBdigraph\fR) \fIname\fP { \fIstatement\(hylist\fP }\fR
.br 
Is the top level graph. If the graph is \fBstrict\fR then multiple edges are
not allowed between the same pairs of nodes.
If it is a directed graph, indicated by \fBdigraph\fR,
then the \fIedgeop\fR must be "\->". If it is an undirected \fBgraph\fR
then the \fIedgeop\fR must be "\-\-".
Statements may be:
.PP
\fIname\fB=\fIval\fB;\fR
.br
\fBnode [\fIname\fB=\fIval\fB];\fR
.br
\fBedge [\fIname\fB=\fIval\fB];\fR
.br
Set default graph, node, or edge attribute \fIname\fP to \fIval\fP.
Any subgraph, node, or edge appearing after this inherits the new
default attributes.
.PP
\fBn0 [\fIname0=val0,name1=val1,...\fB];\fR
Creates node \fBn0\fP (if it does not already exist)
and sets its attributes according to the optional list. 
.PP
\fBn0 \fIedgeop\fR n1 \fIedgeop\fR \fI...\fB \fIedgeop\fR nn [\fIname0=val0,name1=val1,...\fB];\fR
.br
Creates edges between nodes \fBn0\fP, \fBn1\fP, ..., \fBnn\fP and sets
their attributes according to the optional list.
Creates nodes as necessary.
.PP
[\fBsubgraph \fIname\fB] { \fIstatement\(hylist \fB}\fR
.br
Creates a subgraph.  Subgraphs may be used in place
of \fBn0\fP, ..., \fBnn\fP in the above statements to create edges.
[\fBsubgraph \fIname\fR] is optional;
if missing, the subgraph is assigned an internal name. 
.PP
Comments may be /*C\(hylike*/ or //C++\(hylike.

.PP
Attribute names and values are ordinary (C\(hystyle) strings.
The following sections describe attributes that control graph layout.

.SH "GRAPH ATTRIBUTES"
.PP
\fBsize="\fIx,y\fP"\fR sets bounding box of drawing in inches.
.PP
\fBpage="\fIx,y\fP"\fR sets the PostScript pagination unit.
.PP
\fBratio=\fIf\fR sets the aspect ratio to \fIf\fP which may be
a floating point number, or one of the keywords \fBfill\fP,
\fBcompress\fP, or \fBauto\fP.
.PP
\fBpagedir=\fR[TBLR][TBLR] sets the major and minor order of pagination.
.PP
\fBrotate=90\fR sets landscape mode. 
(\fBorientation=land\fR is backward compatible but obsolete.)
.PP
\fBcenter=\fIn\fR a non\(hyzero value centers the drawing on the page.
.PP
\fBlayers="\fIid:id:id:id\fR" is a sequence of layer identifiers for
overlay diagrams.  The PostScript array variable \fIlayercolorseq\fR
sets the assignment of colors to layers. The least index is 1 and 
each element must be a 3\(hyelement array to be interpreted as a color coordinate.
.PP
\fBcolor=\fIcolorvalue\fR sets foreground color (\fBbgcolor\fP for background).
.PP
\fBhref=\fI"url"\fR the default url for image map files; in PostScript files,
the base URL for all relative URLs, as recognized by Acrobat Distiller
3.0 and up.
.PP
\fBURL=\fI"url"\fR ("URL" is a synonym for "href".)
.PP
\fBstylesheet=\fI"file.css"\fR includes a reference to a stylesheet
in \-Tsvg and \-Tsvgz outputs.  Ignored by other formats.
.PP
\fBsplines\fR. If set to \fItrue\fR, edges are
drawn as splines.
If set to \fIpolyline\fR, edges are 
drawn as polylines.
If set to \fIortho\fR, edges are 
drawn as orthogonal polylines.
In all of these cases, the nodes may not overlap.
If \fBsplines=\fIfalse\fR or \fBsplines=\fIline\fR, edges are 
drawn as line segments.
The default is \fIfalse\fR.

.SH "NODE ATTRIBUTES"
.PP
\fBheight=\fId\fR or \fBwidth=\fId\fR sets minimum height or width.
Adding \fBfixedsize=true\fP forces these to be the actual size
(text labels are ignored).
.PP
\fBshape=record polygon epsf \fIbuiltin_polygon\fR
.br
\fIbuiltin_polygon\fR is one of: \fBplaintext ellipse oval circle egg 
triangle box diamond trapezium parallelogram house hexagon octagon
note tab box3d component.\fR
(Polygons are defined or modified by the following node attributes:
\fBregular\fR, \fBperipheries\fR, \fBsides\fR, \fBorientation\fR,
\fBdistortion\fR and \fBskew\fR.)  \fBepsf\fR uses the node's
\fBshapefile\fR attribute as the path name of an external
EPSF file to be automatically loaded for the node shape.
.PP
\fBlabel=\fItext\fR where \fItext\fP may include escaped newlines
\\\|n, \\\|l, or \\\|r for center, left, and right justified lines.
The string '\\N' value will be replaced by the node name.
The string '\\G' value will be replaced by the graph name.
Record labels may contain recursive box lists delimited by { | }.
Port identifiers in labels are set off by angle brackets < >.
In the graph file, use colon (such as, \fBnode0:port28\fR).
.PP
\fBfontsize=\fIn\fR sets the label type size to \fIn\fP points.
.PP
\fBfontname=\fIname\fR sets the label font family name.
.PP

if style=filled and \fBfillcolor\fR is not specified.
.PP
\fBfillcolor=\fIcolorvalue\fR sets the fill color
when style=filled.  If not specified, the fillcolor when style=filled defaults
to be the same as the outline color.
.PP
\fBfontcolor=\fIcolorvalue\fR sets the label text color.
.PP
A \fIcolorvalue\fP may be "\fIh,s,v\fB"\fR (hue, saturation, brightness)
floating point numbers between 0 and 1, or an X11 color name such as
\fBwhite black red green blue yellow magenta cyan\fR or \fBburlywood\fR,
or a "\fI#rrggbb" (red, green, blue, 2 hex characters each) value.
.PP
\fBstyle=filled solid dashed dotted bold invis\fP or any Postscript code.
.PP
\fBlayer=\fIid\fR or \fIid:id\fR or "all" sets the node's active layers.
The empty string means no layers (invisible).
.PP
The following attributes apply only to polygon shape nodes:
.PP
\fBregular=\fIn\fR if \fIn\fR is non\(hyzero then the polygon is made 
regular, i.e. symmetric about the x and y axis, otherwise the
polygon takes on the aspect ratio of the label. 
\fIbuiltin_polygons\fR that are not already regular are made regular
by this attribute.
\fIbuiltin_polygons\fR that are already regular are not affected (i.e.
they cannot be made asymmetric).
.PP
\fBperipheries=\fIn\fR sets the number of periphery lines drawn around
the polygon.  This value supersedes the number of periphery lines
of \fIbuiltin_polygons\fR.
.PP
\fBsides=\fIn\fR sets the number of sides to the polygon. \fIn\fR<3
results in an ellipse.
This attribute is ignored by \fIbuiltin_polygons\fR.
.PP
\fBorientation=\fIf\fR sets the orientation of the first apex of the
polygon counterclockwise from the vertical, in degrees.
\fIf\fR may be a floating point number.
The orientation of labels is not affected by this attribute.
This attribute is added to the initial orientation of \fIbuiltin_polygons.\fR
.PP
\fBdistortion=\fIf\fR sets the amount of broadening of the top and
narrowing of the bottom of the polygon (relative to its orientation). 
Floating point values between \-1 and +1 are suggested.
This attribute is ignored by \fIbuiltin_polygons\fR.
.PP                                                            
\fBskew=\fIf\fR sets the amount of right\(hydisplacement of the top and
left\(hydisplacement of the bottom of the polygon (relative to its
orientation).
Floating point values between \-1 and +1 are suggested.
This attribute is ignored by \fIbuiltin_polygons\fR.
.PP
\fBhref=\fI"url"\fR sets the url for the node in imagemap, PostScript and SVG
files.

.PP
\fBURL=\fI"url"\fR ("URL" is a synonym for "href".)
.PP
\fBtarget=\fI"target"\fR is a target string for client\(hyside imagemaps
and SVG, effective when nodes have a URL.
The target string is used to determine which window of the browser is used
for the URL.  Setting it to "_graphviz" will open a new window if it doesn't
already exist, or reuse it if it does.
If the target string is empty, the default,
then no target attribute is included in the output.
The substrings '\\N' and '\\G' are substituted in the same manner as
for the node label attribute.
Additionally the substring '\\L' is substituted with the node label string.
.PP
\fBtooltip=\fI"tooltip"\fR is a tooltip string for client\(hyside imagemaps
and SVG, effective when nodes have a URL.  The tooltip string defaults to be the
same as the label string, but this attribute permits nodes without
labels to still have tooltips thus permitting denser graphs.
The substrings '\\N' and '\\G' are substituted in the same manner as
for the node label attribute.
Additionally the substring '\\L' is substituted with the node label string.


.SH "EDGE ATTRIBUTES"
.PP
\fBlabel=\fItext\fR where \fItext\fR may include escaped newlines

If the substring '\\H' is found in a label it will be replaced by the head_node name.
If the substring '\\E' value is found in a label it will be replaced by: tail_node_name\->head_node_name
If the substring '\\G' is found in a label it will be replaced by the graph name.
or by: tail_node_name\-\-head_node_name for undirected graphs.
