.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gvpack
reads in a stream of graphs, combines the graphs into a single
layout, and produces a single graph serving as the union of the
input graphs. The input graphs must be in dot format, and must have
all necessary layout information. Acceptable input is produced
by applying a Graphviz layout program, such as \fBdot\fP or \fBneato\fP, 
with no \fB\-T\fP flag.
.P
By default, the packing is done at the cluster level. Thus, parts of
one graph will not intrude into any top\(hylevel clusters or overlap
any nodes or edges of another.
.P
The output of \fBgvpack\fP can be used to produce concrete output
by applying \fBneato \-s \-n2\fP with the desired \fB\-T\fP flag.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.B \-g
Combines the graphs at the graph level. This uses more space, but prevents
parts of one graph from occurring between parts of another. 
.TP
.BI \-array\fI[_flags][n]\fP
Combines the graphs at the graph level, placing them in an array.
By default, the layout is done in row-major order. The number of columns
used is roughly the square root of the number of graphs. If the optional
integer \fIn\fP is supplied, this indicates the number of columns to use.
.TP 

If optional flags are supplied, these consist of an underscore followed
by any of the letters "c", "t", "b", "l", "r" or "u".
If "c" is supplied, the graphs are packed in column-major order, in which
case a final integer specifies the number of rows.
The flags "t", "b", "l", "r" indicate that components are aligned
along the top, bottom, left or right, respectively.
The "u" flag indicates that the insertion order is based on the
\fIsortv\fP attribute attached to each graph.
.TP
.BI \-G "name\fB=\fPvalue"
Specifies attributes to be added to the resulting union graph. For
example, this can be used to specify a graph label.
.TP
.BI \-m "margin"
Packs the graphs allowing a margin of \fIoutput\fP points around
the parts.
.TP
.B \-n
Combines the graphs at the node level. Clusters are ignored in the packing.
.TP
.BI \-o "output"
Prints output to the file \fIoutput\fP. If not given, \fBgvpack\fP
uses stdout.
.TP
.BI \-s "graph_name"
Use \fIgraph_name\fP as the name of the root graph. By default, "root"
is used.
.TP
.B \-u
Don't pack the graphs. Just combine them into a single graph.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.
.TP
.B \-?
Prints usage information and exit.
.SH OPERANDS
The following operand is supported:
.TP 8
.I files
Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot format.
If no
.I files
operand is specified,
the standard input will be used.
.SH RETURN CODES
.B gvpack
returns
.B 0
if there were no problems, and non\(hyzero otherwise.
.SH EXAMPLES
.EX
ccomps \-x abc.gv | dot | gvpack | neato \-s \-n2 \-Tps
.EE
This pipeline decomposes the graph in \fIabc.gv\fP into its
connected components, lays out each using \fBdot\fP, packs them all together
again, and produces the final drawing in PostScript. Of course, 
there is nothing to prevent one from using different layouts for
each component.
.SH "BUGS"
All the input graphs must be directed or undirected.
.P
An input graph should not have a label, since this will be used in its
layout. Since \fBgvpack\fP ignores root graph labels, resulting layout
may contain some extra space.
.P
\fBgvpack\fP unsets the bounding box attribute of all non\(hycluster
subgraphs.
