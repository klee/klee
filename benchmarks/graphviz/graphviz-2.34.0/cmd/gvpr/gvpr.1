.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gvpr
(previously known as
.BR gpr )
is a graph stream editor inspired by \fBawk\fP.
It copies input graphs to its
output, possibly transforming their structure and attributes,
creating new graphs, or printing arbitrary information.
The graph model is that provided by
.IR libcgraph (3).
In particular, \fBgvpr\fP reads and writes graphs using the
dot language.
.PP
Basically,
.B gvpr
traverses each input graph, denoted by \fB$G\fP, visiting each node and edge,
matching it with the predicate\(hyaction rules supplied in the input program.
The rules are evaluated in order.
For each predicate evaluating to true, the corresponding 
action is performed. 
During the traversal, the current node or edge being visited
is denoted by \fB$\fP.
.PP
For each input graph, there is a target subgraph, denoted by
\fB$T\fP, initially empty and used to accumulate
chosen entities, and an output graph, \fB$O\fP, used for final processing
and then written to output. 
By default, the output graph is the target graph.
The output graph can be set in the program or, in a limited sense,
on the command line.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-a " args"
The string \fIargs\fP is split into whitespace\(hyseparated tokens, 
with the individual tokens
available as strings in the \fBgvpr\fP program 
as \fBARGV[\fI0\fP],...,ARGV[ARGC\-1]\fR.
Whitespace characters within single or double quoted substrings, or
preceded by a backslash, are ignored as separators. 
In general, a backslash character turns off any special meaning of the
following character.
Note that the tokens derived from multiple \fB\-a\fP flags are concatenated.
.TP
.B \-c
Use the source graph as the output graph.
.TP
.B \-i
Derive the node\(hyinduced subgraph extension of the output graph in the context 
of its root graph.
.TP
.BI \-o " outfile"
Causes the output stream to be written to the specified file; by default,
output is written to \fBstdout\fP.
.TP
.BI \-f " progfile"
Use the contents of the specified file as the program to execute
on the input. If \fIprogfile\fP contains a slash character, the name is taken
as the pathname of the file. Otherwise, \fBgvpr\fP will use the
directories specified in the environment variable \fBGVPRPATH\fP to look
for the file. If 
.B \-f
is not given,
.B gvpr
will use the first non\(hyoption argument as the program.
.TP
.B \-q
Turns off warning messages.
.TP
.B \-n
Turns off graph read-ahead. By default, the variable \fB$NG\fP is set to the next
graph to be processed. This requires a read of the next graph before processing the
current graph, which may block if the next graph is only generated in response to
some action pertaining to the processing of the current graph.
.TP
.B \-V
Causes the program to print version information and exit.
.TP
.B \-?
Causes the program to print usage information and exit.
.SH OPERANDS
The following operand is supported:
.TP 8
.I files
Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in the dot language.
If no
.B \-f
option is given, the first name is removed from the list and used 
as the input program. If the list of files is empty, \fBstdin\fP will be used.
.SH PROGRAMS
A
.B gvpr
program consists of a list of predicate\(hyaction clauses, having one
of the forms:
.IP
.BI "BEGIN { "  action " }"
.IP
.BI "BEG_G { "  action " }"
.IP
.BI "N [ " predicate " ] { " action " }
.IP
.BI "E [ " predicate " ] { " action " }
.IP
.BI "END_G { "  action " }"
.IP
.BI "END { "  action " }"
.PP
A program can contain at most one of each of the \fBBEGIN\fP, 
\fBEND_G\fP and \fBEND\fP clauses. 
There can be any number of \fBBEG_G\fP, \fBN\fP and \fBE\fP statements,
the first applied to graphs, the second to nodes, the third to edges.
These are separated into blocks, a block consisting of an optional
\fBBEG_G\fP statement and all \fBN\fP and \fBE\fP statements up to 
the next \fBBEG_G\fP statement, if any.
The top\(hylevel semantics of a \fBgvpr\fP program are:
.PP
.RS
.nf
Evaluate the \fBBEGIN\fP clause, if any.
For each input graph \fIG\fP {
    For each block {
        Set \fIG\fP as the current graph and current object.
        Evaluate the \fBBEG_G\fP clause, if any.
        For each node and edge in \fIG\fP {
            Set the node or edge as the current object.
            Evaluate the \fBN\fP or \fBE\fP clauses, as appropriate.
        } 
    } 
    Set \fIG\fP as the current object.
    Evaluate the \fBEND_G\fP clause, if any.
} 
Evaluate the \fBEND\fP clause, if any.
.fi
.RE
.DT
.PP
The actions of the \fBBEGIN\fP, \fBBEG_G\fP, \fBEND_G\fP and \fBEND\fP clauses
are performed when the clauses are evaluated.
For \fBN\fP or \fBE\fP clauses,
either the predicate or action may be omitted. 
If there is no predicate with an action, the action is 
performed on every node or edge, as appropriate.
If there is no action and the predicate evaluates to true,
the associated node or edge is added to the target graph. 
.PP
The blocks are evaluated in the order in which they occur.
Within a block, the \fBN\fP clauses 
(\fBE\fP clauses, respectively) are evaluated in the
order in which the occur. Note, though, that within a block, 
\fBN\fP or \fBE\fP clauses may be interlaced, depending on the
traversal order.
.PP
Predicates and actions are sequences of statements in the C dialect 
supported by the
.IR expr (3)
library.
The only difference between predicates and actions is that the former
must have a type that may interpreted as either true or false.
Here the usual C convention is followed, in which a non\(hyzero value is
considered true. This would include non\(hyempty strings and non\(hyempty
references to nodes, edges, etc. However, if a string can be 
converted to an integer, this value is used.
.PP
In addition to the usual C base types
(\fBvoid\fP, \fBint\fP, \fBchar\fP, \fBfloat\fP, \fBlong\fP, 
\fBunsigned\fP and \fBdouble\fP), 
\fBgvpr\fP \fRprovides \fBstring\fP as a synonym for \fBchar*\fP, and 
the graph\(hybased types \fBnode_t\fP,
\fBedge_t\fP, \fBgraph_t\fP and \fBobj_t\fP.
The \fBobj_t\fP type can be viewed as a supertype of the other 3 concrete types;
the correct base type is maintained dynamically.
Besides these base types, the only other supported type expressions
are (associative) arrays. 
.PP
Constants follow C syntax, but strings may be quoted with either
\fB"..."\fP or \fB'...'\fP.
\fBgvpr\fP accepts C++ comments as well as cpp\(hytype comments.
For the latter, if a line begins with a '#' character, the rest of
the line is ignored.
.PP
A statement can be a declaration of a function, a variable
or an array, or an executable statement. For declarations, there
is a single scope. Array declarations have the form: 
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fI type array \fB[\fP type0 \fB]\fR
.fi
.RE
.DT
.PP
where \fI type0 \fP is optional. If it is supplied, the parser will 
enforce that all array subscripts have the specified type. If it is
not supplied, objects of all types can be used as subscripts.
As in C, variables and arrays must
be declared. In particular, an undeclared variable will be interpreted
as the name of an attribute of a node, edge or graph, depending on the
context.
.PP
Executable statements can be one of the following:
.RS
.TS
l l.
\fB{\fR [\fI statement ... \fR] \fB}\fR
\fIexpression\fP	\fR// commonly\fP\fI var \fB=\fP expression\fR
\fBif(\fI expression \fP)\fI statement \fR[ \fBelse\fI statement \fR]
\fBfor(\fI expression \fP;\fI expression \fP;\fI expression \fP)\fI statement\fP
\fBfor(\fI array \fP[\fI var \fP])\fI statement\fP
\fBforr(\fI array \fP[\fI var \fP])\fI statement\fP
\fBwhile(\fI expression \fP)\fI statement\fP
\fBswitch(\fI expression \fP)\fI case statements\fP
\fBbreak [\fI expression \fP]
\fBcontinue [\fI expression \fP]
\fBreturn [\fI expression \fP]\fR
.TE
.RE
.SM
Items in brackets are optional.
.PP
In the second form of the \fBfor\fP statement and the \fBforr\fP statement, the variable \fIvar\fP
is set to each value used as an index in the specified array and then
the associated \fIstatement\fP is evaluated. For numeric and string indices, the indices are 
returned in increasing (decreasing) numeric or lexicographic order for 
\fBfor\fP (\fBforr\fP, respectively). This can be used for sorting.
.PP
Function definitions can only appear in the \fBBEGIN\fP clause.
.PP
Expressions include the usual C expressions. 
String comparisons using \fB==\fP and \fB!=\fP
treat the right hand operand as a pattern
for the purpose of regular expression matching.
Patterns use
.IR ksh (1)
file match pattern syntax.
(For simple string equality, use the \fBstrcmp\fP function.
.PP
\fBgvpr\fP will attempt to use an expression as a string or numeric value 
as appropriate. Both C-like casts and function templates will cause
conversions to be performed, if possible.
.PP
Expressions of graphical type (i.e., \fBgraph_t, node_t,
edge_t, obj_t\fP) may be followed by a field reference in the
form of \fB.\fP\fIname\fP. The resulting value is the value
of the attribute named \fIname\fP of the given object.
In addition, in certain contexts an undeclared, unmodified
identifier is taken to be an
attribute name. Specifically, such identifiers denote attributes
of the current node or edge, respectively, in \fBN\fP
and \fBE\fP clauses, and the current graph in \fBBEG_G\fP and \fBEND_G\fP
clauses.
.PP
As usual in the 
.IR libcgraph (3)
model, attributes are string\(hyvalued.
In addition,
.B gvpr
supports certain pseudo\(hyattributes of graph objects, not necessarily
string\(hyvalued. These reflect intrinsic properties of the graph objects
and cannot be set by the user.
.TP
\fBhead\fR : \fBnode_t\fR
the head of an edge.
.TP
\fBtail\fR : \fBnode_t\fR
the tail of an edge.
.TP
\fBname\fR : \fBstring\fR
the name of an edge, node or graph. The name of an edge has the
form "\fI<tail\(hyname><edge\(hyop><head\(hyname>\fB[\fI<key>\fB]\fR",
where \fI<edge\(hyop>\fP is "\fB\->\fP" or "\fB\-\-\fP" depending on
whether the graph is directed or not. The bracket part \fB[\fI<key>\fB]\fR
only appears if the edge has a non\(hytrivial key.
.TP
\fBindegree\fR : \fBint\fR
the indegree of a node.
.TP
\fBoutdegree\fR : \fBint\fR
the outdegree of a node.
.TP
\fBdegree\fR : \fBint\fR

is itself.
.TP

the parent graph of a subgraph. The parent of a root graph
is \fBNULL\fP
.TP
\fBn_edges\fR : \fBint\fR
the number of edges in the graph
.TP
\fBn_nodes\fR : \fBint\fR
the number of nodes in the graph
.TP

true (non\(hyzero) if the graph is directed
.TP
\fBstrict\fR : \fBint\fR
true (non\(hyzero) if the graph is strict

strict, and non\(hystrict, respectively. If \fIt\fP is empty,
a directed, non\(hystrict graph is generated.

This can be useful when using \fBfstedge\fP and \fBnxtedge\fP
to enumerate the neighbors of \fIn\fP.
.SS "Graph I/O"
.TP
\fBwrite\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP) : \fBvoid\fP
prints \fIg\fP in dot format onto the output stream.
.TP

prints \fIg\fP in dot format into the file \fIfname\fP.
.TP

by the integer \fIfd\fP.
.TP
\fBreadG\fP(\fIfname\fP : \fBstring\fP) : \fBgraph_t\fP
returns a graph read from the file \fIfname\fP. The graph should be
in dot format. If no graph can be read, \fBNULL\fP is returned.
.TP
\fBfreadG\fP(\fIfd\fP : \fBint\fP) : \fBgraph_t\fP
returns the next graph read from the open stream \fIfd\fP.
Returns \fBNULL\fP at end of file.
.SS "Graph miscellany"
.TP
\fBdelete\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIx\fP : \fBobj_t\fP) : \fBvoid\fP
deletes object \fIx\fP from graph \fIg\fP.
If \fIg\fP is \fBNULL\fP, the function uses the root graph of \fIx\fP.
If \fIx\fP is a graph or subgraph, it is closed unless \fIx\fP is locked.
.TP
\fBisIn\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIx\fP : \fBobj_t\fP) : \fBint\fP
returns true if \fIx\fP is in subgraph \fIg\fP.
.TP
\fBcloneG\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIs\fP : \fBstring\fP) : \fBgraph_t\fP
creates a clone of graph \fIg\fP with name of \fIs\fP.
If \fIs\fP is "", the created graph has the same name as \fIg\fP.
.TP
\fBclone\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIx\fP : \fBobj_t\fP) : \fBobj_t\fP
creates a clone of object \fIx\fP in graph \fIg\fP.
In particular, the new object has the same name/value attributes
and structure as the original object.
If an object with the same key as \fIx\fP already exists, its attributes
are overlaid by those of \fIx\fP and the object is returned.
If an edge is cloned, both endpoints are implicitly cloned.
If a graph is cloned, all nodes, edges and subgraphs are implicitly
cloned.
If \fIx\fP is a graph, \fIg\fP may be \fBNULL\fP, in which case the cloned
object will be a new root graph. In this case, the call is equivalent
to \fBcloneG(\fP\fIx\fP\fB,"")\fP.
.TP
\fBcopy\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIx\fP : \fBobj_t\fP) : \fBobj_t\fP
creates a copy of object \fIx\fP in graph \fIg\fP,
where the new object has the same name/value attributes
as the original object.
If an object with the same key as \fIx\fP already exists, its attributes
are overlaid by those of \fIx\fP and the object is returned.
Note that this is a shallow copy. If \fIx\fP is a graph, none of its nodes, 
edges or subgraphs are copied into the new graph. If \fIx\fP is an edge,
the endpoints are created if necessary, but they are not cloned.
If \fIx\fP is a graph, \fIg\fP may be \fBNULL\fP, in which case the cloned
object will be a new root graph.
.TP
\fBcopyA\fP(\fIsrc\fP : \fBobj_t\fP, \fItgt\fP : \fBobj_t\fP) : \fBint\fP
copies the attributes of object \fIsrc\fP to object \fItgt\fP, overwriting
any attribute values \fItgt\fP may initially have.
.TP
\fBinduce\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP) : \fBvoid\fP
extends \fIg\fP to its node\(hyinduced subgraph extension in its root graph.
.TP
\fBhasAttr\fP(\fIsrc\fP : \fBobj_t\fP, \fIname\fP : \fBstring\fP) : \fBint\fP
returns non-zero if object \fIsrc\fP has an attribute whose name is
\fIname\fP. It returns 0 otherwise.

\fBisAttr\fP(\fIg\fP : \fBgraph_t\fP, \fIkind\fP : \fBstring\fP, \fIname\fP : \fBstring\fP) : \fBint\fP
returns non-zero if an attribute \fIname\fP has been defined in \fIg\fP
for objects of the given \fIkind\fP. For nodes, edges, and graphs, \fIkind\fP
should be "N", "E", and "G", respectively.

useful for those cases when \fIname\fP conflicts with one of the keywords
such as "head" or "root".
If the attribute has not been declared in the graph, the function will
initialize it with a default value of "". To avoid this, one should use
the \fBhasAttr\fP or \fBisAttr\fP function to check that the attribute exists.

the given \fIkind\fP. For nodes, edges, and graphs, \fIkind\fP
should be "N", "E", and "G", respectively.
If the attribute has not been declared in the graph, the function will
initialize it with a default value of "". To avoid this, one should use

returns the connected component of the graph \fIg\fP containing node \fIn\fP,
as a subgraph of \fIg\fP. The subgraph only contains the nodes. One can
use \fIinduce\fP to add the edges. The function fails and returns \fBNULL\fP
if \fIn\fP is not in \fIg\fP. Connectivity is based on the underlying
undirected graph of \fIg\fP.
.TP
\fBkindOf\fP(\fIobj\fP : \fBobj_t\fP) : \fBstring\fP

returns a ``magic'' version  of \fIs\fP as an HTML string. This will typically be
used to attach an HTML-like label to a graph object. Note that the returned string
lives in \fIg\fP. In particular, it will be freed when \fIg\fP is closed, and to
act as an HTML string, it has to be used with an object of \fIg\fP. In addition,
note that the
angle bracket quotes should not be part of \fIs\fP. These will be added if 
\fIg\fP is written in concrete DOT format.

.TP
\fBtokens\fP(\fIs\fP : \fBstring\fP, \fIarr\fP : \fBarray\fP) : \fBint\fP
The \fBsplit\fP function breaks the string \fIs\fP into fields, while the \fBtokens\fP function
breaks the string into tokens. 
A field consists of all non-separator characters between two separator characters or the beginning or
end of the string. Thus, a field may be the empty string. A
token is a maximal, non-empty substring not containing a separator character.
The separator characters are those given in the \fIseps\fP argument.
If \fIseps\fP is not provided, the default value is " \\t\\n". 
The functions return the number of fields or tokens.
.sp
The fields and tokens are stored in the argument array. The array must be \fBstring\fP-valued and,
if an index type is specified, it must be \fBint\fP. The entries are indexed by consecutive
integers, starting at 0. Any values already stored in the array will be either overwritten, or
still be present after the function returns.

The default value is \fBNULL\fP for each input graph.
After the traversal at the given root, if the value of \fB$tvroot\fP has changed,
a new traversal will begin with the new value of \fB$tvroot\fP. Also, set \fB$tvnext\fP below.
.TP
\fB$tvnext\fP : \fBnode_t\fP
indicates the next starting node for a (directed or undirected)

.TQ
\fBTV_prepostdfs\fR : \fItvtype_t\fR
a traversal of the graph using a depth\(hyfirst search on the
underlying undirected graph. 
To do the traversal, \fBgvpr\fP will check the value of
\fB$tvroot\fP. If this has the same value that it had previously
(at the start, the previous value is initialized to \fBNULL\fP.), \fBgvpr\fP
will simply look for some unvisited node and traverse its connected
component. On the other hand, if \fB$tvroot\fP has changed, its connected
component will be toured, assuming it has not been previously visited or,
if \fB$tvroot\fP is \fBNULL\fP, the traversal will stop. Note that using
\fBTV_dfs\fP and \fB$tvroot\fP, it is possible to create an infinite loop.
.

By default, the traversal is done in pre-order. That is, a node is
visited before all of its unvisited edges. For \fBTV_postdfs\fR,
all of a node's unvisited edges are visited before the node. For

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B GVPRPATH
Colon\(hyseparated list of directories to be searched to find
the file specified by the \-f option. \fBgvpr\fP has a default list built in. If \fBGVPRPATH\fP
is not defined, the default list is used. If \fBGVPRPATH\fP starts with colon, the list is formed
by appending \fBGVPRPATH\fP to the default list. If \fBGVPRPATH\fP ends with colon, the list is formed
by appending the default list to \fBGVPRPATH\fP. Otherwise, \fBGVPRPATH\fP is used for the list.
.P
On Windows systems, replace ``colon'' with ``semicolon'' in the previous paragraph.
.SH BUGS AND WARNINGS
Scripts should be careful deleting nodes during \fBN{}\fP and \fBE{}\fP
blocks using BFS and DFS traversals as these rely on stacks and queues of
nodes. 
.PP
When the program is given as a command line argument, the usual
shell interpretation takes place, which may affect some of the
special names in \fBgvpr\fP. To avoid this, it is best to wrap the
program in single quotes.
.PP
If string constants contain pattern metacharacters that you want to
escape to avoid pattern matching, two backslashes will probably be
necessary, as a single backslash will be lost when the string is
originally scanned. Usually, it is simpler to use \fBstrcmp\fP to
avoid pattern matching.
.PP
As of 24 April 2008, \fBgvpr\fP switched to using a new, underlying
graph library, which uses the simpler model that there is only one
copy of a node, not one copy for each subgraph logically containing
it. This means that iterators such as \fInxtnode\fP cannot traverse
a subgraph using just a node argument. For this reason, subgraph
traversal requires new functions ending in "_sg", which also take
a subgraph argument. The versions without that suffix will always
traverse the root graph.
.PP
There is a single global scope, except for formal function parameters,
and even these can interfere with the type system. Also, the 
extent of all variables is the entire life of the program. 
It might be preferable for scope
to reflect the natural nesting of the clauses, or for the program
to at least reset locally declared variables.
For now, it is advisable to use distinct names for all variables.
.PP
If a function ends with a complex statement, such as an
IF statement, with each branch doing a return, type checking may fail. 
Functions should use a return at the end.
.PP
The expr library does not support string values of (char*)0.
This means we can't distinguish between "" and (char*)0 edge keys.
For the purposes of looking up and creating edges, we translate "" 
to be (char*)0, since this latter value is
necessary in order to look up any edge with a matching head and tail.
.PP
Related to this, strings converted to integers act like char pointers,
getting the value 0 or 1 depending on whether the string consists
solely of zeroes or not. Thus, the ((int)"2") evaluates to 1.
.PP
The language inherits the usual C problems such as dangling references
and the confusion between '=' and '=='.
