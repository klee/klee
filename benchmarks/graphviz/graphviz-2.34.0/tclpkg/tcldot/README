INTRODUCTION

tcldot adds graph manipulation facilities to tcl based on the
capabilities of dot.  It permits a script programmer to add and delete
nodes and edges to abstract graphs, then have the graph layed out
according to dot's heuristics about what makes an eye-pleasing graph.
The graph can rendered in various forms including to tk's canvas.

tcldot is distributed with the Graph Visualization tools available
