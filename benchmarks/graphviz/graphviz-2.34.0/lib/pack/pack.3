.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIlibpack\fP supports the use of connected components in the
context of laying out graphs using other \fIgraphviz\fP libraries.
One set of functions can be used to take a single graph and
break it apart into connected components. A complementary set
of functions takes a collection of graphs (not necessarily components
of a single graph) which have been laid out separately, and packs them
together.

As this library is meant to be used with \fIlibcommon\fP, it relies
on the \fIAgraphinfo_t\fP, \fIAgnodeinfo_t\fP and \fIAgedgeinfo_t\fP used 
in that
library. The specific dependencies are given below in the function
descriptions.

.SS "Creating components"
.PP
.SS "  Agraph_t** ccomps (Agraph_t* g, int* cnt, char* pfx)"
The function \fIccomps\fP takes a graph \fIg\fP and returns an array
of pointers to subgraphs of \fIg\fP which are its connected components.
\fIcnt\fP is set to the number of components. If \fIpfx\fP is non-NULL,
it is used as a prefix for the names of the subgraphs; otherwise, the
string ``_cc_'' is used.
Note that the subgraphs only contain the relevant nodes, not any
corresponding edges. Depending on the use, this allows the caller
to retrieve edge information from the root graph.
.PP
The array returned is obtained from \fImalloc\fP and must be freed by
the caller. The function relies on the \fImark\fP field in
\fIAgnodeinfo_t\fP.
.PP
.SS "  Agraph_t** pccomps (Agraph_t* g, int* cnt, char* pfx, boolean* pinned)"
This is identical to \fIccomps\fP except that is puts all pinned nodes
in the first component returned. In addition, if \fIpinned\fP is non-NULL,
it is set to true if pinned nodes are found and false otherwise.
.PP
.SS "  int nodeInduce (Agraph_t* g)"
This function takes a subgraph \fIg\fP and finds all edges in its root
graph both of whose endpoints are in \fIg\fP. It returns the number of
such edges and, if this edge is not already
in the subgraph, it is added.
.PP
.SS "  int isConnected (Agraph_t* g)"
This function returns non-zero if the graph \fIg\fP is connected.

.SS "Packing components"
.PP
.SS "  point* putGraphs (int ng, Agraph_t** gs, Agraph_t* root, pack_info ip)"
\fIputGraphs\fP packs together a collection of laid out graphs into a
single layout which avoids any overlap. It takes as input \fIng\fP 
graphs \fIgs\fP. For each graph, it is assumed that all the nodes have
been positioned using \fIpos\fP, and that the \fIxsize\fP and \fIysize\fP
fields have been set.
.PP
If \fIroot\fP is non-NULL, it is taken as the root
graph of the subgraphs \fIgs\fP and is used to find the edges. Otherwise, 
\fIputGraphs\fP uses the edges found in each graph \fIgs[i]\fP.
.PP
For the modes \fIl_node\fP, \fIl_clust\fP, and \fIl_graph\fP,
the packing is done using the polyomino-based
algorithm of Freivalds et al. This allows for a fairly tight packing, in
which a convex part of one graph might be inserted into the concave part
of another.
The granularity of the polyominoes used depends on the value of
\fIip->mode\fP. If this is \fIl_node\fP, a polyomino is constructed
to approximate the nodes and edges. If this is \fIl_clust\fP, the
polyomino treats top-level clusters as single rectangles, unioned
with the polyominoes for the remaining nodes and edges. If the value
is \fIl_graph\fP, the polyomino for a graph is a single rectangle
corresponding to the bounding box of the graph.
.PP
The mode \fIl_node\fP specifies that the graphs should be packed as an
array.
.PP
If \fIip->doSplines\fP is true, the function uses the spline information
in the \fIspl\fP field of an edge, if it exists. 
Otherwise, the algorithm represents an edge as a 
straight line segment connecting node centers.
.PP
The parameter \fIip->margin\fP specifies a boundary of \fImargin\fP points 
to be allowed around each node. It must be non-negative.
.PP
The parameter \fIip->fixed\fP, if non-null, should point to an array
of \fIng\fP booleans. If \fIip->fixed[i]\fP is true, graph \fIgs[i]\fP
should be left at its original position. The packing will first first
place all of the fixed graphs, then fill in the with the remaining
graphs.
.PP
The function returns an array of points which can be used as the origin of 
the bounding box of each graph. If the
graphs are translated to these positions, none of the graph components
will overlap. 
The array returned is obtained from \fImalloc\fP and must be freed by
the caller. If any problem occurs, \fIputGraphs\fP returns NULL.
As a side-effect, at its start, \fIputGraphs\fP sets the \fIbb\fP 
of each graph to reflect its initial layout. Note that \fIputGraphs\fP
does not do any translation or change the input graphs in any other way
than setting the \fIbb\fP.
.PP
This function uses the \fIbb\fP field in \fIAgraphinfo_t\fP,
the \fIpos\fP, \fIxsize\fP and \fIysize\fP fields in \fInodehinfo_t\fP and
the \fIspl\fP field in \fIAedgeinfo_t\fP.
.PP
.SS "  int packGraphs (int ng, Agraph_t** gs, Agraph_t* root, pack_info* ip)"
This function takes \fIng\fP subgraphs \fIgs\fP of a root graph \fIroot\fP
and calls \fIputGraphs\fP with the given arguments to generate
a packing of the subgraphs. If successful, it then invokes
shifts the subgraphs to their new positions. It returns 0 on success.
.PP
.SS "  int packSubgraphs (int ng, Agraph_t** gs, Agraph_t* root, pack_info* ip)"
This function simply calls \fIpackGraphs\fP with the given arguments, and
then recomputes the bounding box of the \fIroot\fP graph.
.PP
.SS "  int pack_graph(int ng, Agraph_t** gs, Agraph_t* root, boolean* fixed)"
uses \fIpackSubgraphs\fP to place the individual subgraphs into a single layout
with the parameters obtained from \fIgetPackInfo\fP. If successful, 
\fIdotneato_postprocess\fP is called on the root graph.
.PP
.SS "  point* putRects (int ng, boxf* bbs, pack_info* ip)"
\fIputRects\fP packs together a collection of rectangles into a
single layout which avoids any overlap. It takes as input \fIng\fP 
rectangles \fIbbs\fP.
.PP
Its behavior and return value are analogous to those of \fIputGraphs\fP.
However, the modes \fIl_node\fP and \fIl_clust\fP are illegal.
The fields \fIfixed\fP and \fIdoSplines\fP of \fIip\fP
are unused.
.PP
.SS "  int packRects (int ng, boxf* bbs, pack_info* ip)"
\fIpackRects\fP is analogous to \fIpackGraphs\fP: it calls
\fIputRects\fP and, if this is successful, it translates
the rectangles in \fIbbs\fP appropriately.
.SS "Utility functions"
The library provides several functions which can be used to tailor the
packing based on graph attributes.
.SS "  pack_mode parsePackModeInfo(char* p, pack_mode dflt, pack_info* pinfo)"
analyzes \fIp\fP as a string representation of pack mode, storing the
information in \fIpinfo\fP.
If \fIp\fP is "cluster", it returns
\fIl_clust\fP; for "graph", it returns \fIl_graph\fP;
for "node", it returns \fIl_node\fP;
for "array", it returns \fIl_array\fP;
for "aspect", it returns \fIl_aspect\fP;
otherwise, it returns \fIdflt\fP.
Related data is also stored in \fIpinfo\fP.
.SS "  pack_mode getPackModeInfo(Agraph_t * g, pack_mode dflt, pack_info* pinfo)"
This function processes the graph's \fI"packmode"\fP attribute, storing the
information in \fIpinfo\fP. It returns \fIpinfo->mode\fP.
The attribute is processed using \fIparsePackModeInfo\fP with \fIdflt\fP passed
as the default argument.
.SS "  pack_mode getPackMode (Agraph_t* g, pack_mode dflt)"
This function returns a \fIpack_mode\fP associated with \fIg\fP.
.SS "  int getPack (Agraph_t* g, int not_def, int dflt)"
This function queries the graph attribute \fI"pack"\fP. If this is
defined as a non-negative integer, the integer is returned; if it
is defined as "true", the value \fIdflt\fP is returned; otherwise,
the value \fInot_def\fP is returned.
.SS "  pack_mode getPackInfo(Agraph_t * g, pack_mode dflt, int dfltMargin, pack_info* pinfo)"
This function calls both \fIgetPackModeInfo\fP and \fIgetPack\fP, storing the
information in \fIpinfo\fP. \fIdfltMargin\fP is used for both integer arguments 
of \fIgetPack\fP, with the result saved as \fIpinfo->margin\fP.
It returns \fIpinfo->mode\fP.
